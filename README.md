## 📊 What is a Pentagon Chart?

Pentagon charts visualize pairwise statistical comparisons between five conditions. They're particularly useful for:

- Displaying multiple pairwise comparisons simultaneously
- Showing which condition pairs have significant differences
- Comparing mean values across conditions
- Academic research in psychology, education, and social sciences

### Visual Elements

- **Circles**: Sized proportionally to mean values
- **Solid Lines**: Indicate statistically significant differences (with z-scores)
- **Dotted Lines**: Show non-significant differences
- **Center Label**: Names the variable being measured
